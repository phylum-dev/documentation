#### Phylum provides a comprehensive, scalable approach to defending your software supply chain. Get started with one or all of the below capabilities.

# Detect & Prevent

_Analyze risks and block threats from entering source code._

## Analyze Your First Project

### Download and Install the Phylum CLI

The Phylum CLI is available for a [variety of operating systems on
GitHub](https://github.com/phylum-dev/cli/releases/latest). However, you can
easily install the CLI with the following:

```sh
curl https://sh.phylum.io | sh
```

Once installed, authenticate your local development environment by running:

```sh
phylum auth login
```

![Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phylum-dev/documentation/main/assets/cli-login.webp)

### Setup Your Phylum Project

All analysis jobs *_must_* be associated with a Phylum project. To setup your
project, run the following:

```sh
phylum init
```

![Create Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phylum-dev/documentation/main/assets/phylum-init.webp)

### Analyze your Project

To begin analyzing your project for software supply chain risks, submit your
dependency files to Phylum.

Resource: https://blog.phylum.io/insights-and-resources/pick-a-python-lockfile-and-improve-security

```sh
phylum analyze
```

### (Optional) View Results in the Phylum UI

After submitting your project, view the results in the [web
UI](https://app.phylum.io).

# Defend Developers

### (See results in less than 5 minutes)

_Defend your developers and workstations from malicious code and prevent the
theft of SSH keys. Block suspect open-source containers automatically by
leveraging Phylum Bird Cage (Sandbox) and pre-install checks._

![Pre-Install Checks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phylum-dev/documentation/main/assets/compare.webp)

- _Contained in the Phylum CLI:_
- Phylum allows you to defend your developers by running pre-install checks,
  shown in the video above.
- Safely quarantine packages during install with [Phylum Sandbox
  (Birdcage)](https://github.com/phylum-dev/birdcage), which will restrict
  access to the filesystem, network, and environment variables.
  - Put these tools into action by running: `phylum npm install`
