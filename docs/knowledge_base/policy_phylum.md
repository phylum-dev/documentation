# Phylum Policies

Out of the box, projects and groups have access to about two dozen of policy regos authored by Phylum. 
To explore these is the web UI:


1. Open the `Policy` tab of an existing group page (create new group if you do not have any)
2. Select  `Phylum` and `Available` to see the list of all policies authored by Phylum
4. Click the title on any card to open and read the respective rego

Curated subset of the Phylum policy regos will be automatically active on newly created groups and personal projects to insure Phylum analysis captures all significant vulnerabilities and issues from the get-go.
