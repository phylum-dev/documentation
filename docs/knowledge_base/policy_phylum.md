# Phylum Policies

Out of the box, Phylum provides roughly two dozen pre-defined policies that allow users to specify what their organization's acceptable use policies are for open source packages

To explore these in the web UI:


1. Open the `Policy` tab of an existing group page (create new group if you do not have any)
2. Select  `Phylum` and `Available` to see the list of all policies authored by Phylum
4. Click the title on any card to open and read the respective rego

A curated subset of the Phylum policies will be automatically active on newly created groups and personal projects to ensure Phylum surfaces potential risks in your projects.
