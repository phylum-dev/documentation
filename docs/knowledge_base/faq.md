## How long does it take for a newly published package to be processed by Phylum?

The Phylum application is continuously ingesting and processing packages for all supported ecosystems in an attempt to
provide nearly instant analysis results. If a package is submitted for analysis that has not already been pre-processed,
the application will take approximately 30 minutes to acquire the package and run the heuristics and rules to produce
the final package score.

NOTE: This process is parallelized. Having one, or 100, packages processing will generally take the same amount of time.
