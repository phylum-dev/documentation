# Overview

Phylum Continuous Monitoring ensures the accuracy of package issue data without requiring the user to re-analyze a project.

## How It Works

The Phylum platform monitors for new issues that impact dependencies in your project and will re-run your policy when one is found. If that issue violates your policy, we will fire off any configured [notifications](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/notifications) and also unsuppress the package if you previously had it suppressed, so you can address the newly found issue.

## How to Activate

No activation required! Continuous Monitoring is a default platform feature for all Phylum accounts. Phylum Pro users have the additional option to trigger [notifications](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/notifications) on new Continuous Monitoring violations.
