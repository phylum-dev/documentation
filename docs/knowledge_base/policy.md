# Policy

Phylum uses a policy framework implemented with [Open Policy Agent] to evaluate dependencies and provide tailored results. A default set of Phylum-provided policies will be applied to all newly created groups/projects. Phylum PRO users may customize their resultant policy by toggling policies on/off in the Phylum UI.

Phylum PRO users may also [develop custom policies](./policy_development.md) using the [rego query language](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) and apply those policies to their groups/projects.
