# Malware Bazaar Check

## Description

MalwareBazaar is a public database that collects and shares known malware samples, enriching them with additional intelligence for community use. At Phylum, we utilize this resource by checking hashes of all files ingested from open source packages against MalwareBazaarâ€™s list of known malicious files. This process helps to identify and flag any components that match malware signatures, thus ensuring that these potentially harmful files are recognized before they can cause damage.

## Importance

Identifying a package that includes a file matching a known malware sample listed in MalwareBazaar's database is a critical finding. It allows developers to further investigate the file on MalwareBazaar, where they can access detailed community-generated intelligence about the specific file.
