# Ruby Install Hooks

## Description

In the RubyGems ecosystem, Ruby install hooks allow the execution of arbitrary code during the installation of a gem via the use of a `rubygems_plugin.rb` file. Developers can specify actions to take place either before (`Gem.pre_install`) or after (`Gem.post_install`) the installation process. This feature is intended for automation of tasks related to gem setup, such as configuring software, checking dependencies, or setting up environment variables.

## Importance

Install hooks in RubyGems are powerful tools that can significantly streamline the setup process for Ruby applications but come with inherent security risks. They permit the execution of arbitrary code, which can be exploited if a malicious gem or a compromised legitimate gem is installed. Therefore, it is crucial for developers to carefully manage and review any gems that utilize install hooks to prevent potential security vulnerabilities in their environments.
