# npm Security Holding

## Description

An npm security holding package, typically marked with a version `0.0.1-security`, is a placeholder version released by npm to replace a package removed from its registry due to security issues. This placeholder prevents malicious actors from reusing the original package name and serves as a notice that previous versions may have contained harmful elements and should no longer be used.

## Importance

The presence of a security holding package indicates that npm has deprecated the original package due to severe security vulnerabilities, making it unsafe for use. Developers discovering that they are using such a package should treat their system as potentially compromised. Immediate steps should be taken to remove the package and conduct a thorough security audit to mitigate any damage and ensure that no malicious code remains in the system.
