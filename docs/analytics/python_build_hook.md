# Python Build Hook

## Description

In the Python ecosystem, a `pyproject.toml` file is used to manage build settings for Python projects. This enables the use of build hooks through various package managers like [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/), [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/), or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org). These build hooks allow developers to run custom code during the build process. This capability is particularly useful for automating build operations, customizing build steps, or integrating complex build requirements such as compiling extension modules.

## Importance

While build hooks offer significant flexibility and power within the Python packaging process, they also pose security risks if not handled carefully. Malicious code can be inserted into these hooks, which then executes during package installation. Such vulnerabilities make it possible for attackers to spread malware or execute arbitrary code on target systems. See [this blog post](https://blog.phylum.io/modern-python-build-hooks/) for more details.
