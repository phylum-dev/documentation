# NuGet Install Scripts

## Description

In the NuGet package management system, install scripts such as `tools/init.ps1` and `tools/install.ps1` are PowerShell scripts executed during the installation of a NuGet package. These scripts are designed to perform setup tasks such as configuring settings, adjusting permissions, or installing additional components required by the package. This automation facilitates the seamless integration of packages into larger projects.

## Importance

While NuGet install scripts provide significant convenience by automating complex installation processes, they also introduce security risks by executing arbitrary PowerShell code during package installation. This can be exploited by malicious actors to execute unauthorized code, potentially leading to system compromise or data breaches. It is essential for developers to exercise caution by inspecting the source and contents of any NuGet package that includes install scripts, ensuring that they come from trustworthy sources and do not contain malicious code.
