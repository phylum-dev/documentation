# Source Code Distribution

## Description

Software packages released under licenses that mandate source code distribution require any derivative works or software incorporating the licensed code to be made available under the same license. This means that if you use, modify, or distribute such software, you must also distribute your own source code under the same licensing terms.

These licenses ensure that the software remains open and accessible, promoting transparency and collaboration. However, they impose obligations that can conflict with commercial interests, particularly if your project involves proprietary software development.

## Importance

Understanding and complying with source distribution requirements is crucial for avoiding legal issues and maintaining the integrity of open-source principles. Non-compliance can lead to legal disputes and the forced open-sourcing of proprietary code, which could undermine business models relying on closed-source software.

## Examples

Several licenses require source code distribution:

- **AGPL (Affero General Public License)**: Any software using AGPL-licensed code, particularly when accessed over a network, must be released under the AGPL license, making your source code publicly accessible.
- **GPL (General Public License)**: Requires that any derivative works be open-sourced under the same GPL license, enforcing similar distribution obligations.

For instance, if you include a library released under the GPL in your proprietary application, you would be required to release your applicationâ€™s source code under the GPL, making it publicly accessible and freely redistributable.
