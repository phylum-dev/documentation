# Base64 Decoding

## Description

Base64 decoding is a common technique used in software development to interpret data encoded in the Base64 format, a method often used to transmit and store data compactly and securely. However, threat actors frequently use Base64-encoding to obscure malicious scripts, payloads, and links within open source software. This encoding allows the harmful content to evade detection by appearing as benign or irrelevant text. Malicious scripts are often dynamically executed via functions like `exec()`, where the encoded script is decoded just before execution, making the detection and static analysis more challenging.

## Importance

The use of Base64-decoding in the execution of encoded scripts is a significant security concern. It enables attackers to inject and execute malicious code within secure environments discreetly.
