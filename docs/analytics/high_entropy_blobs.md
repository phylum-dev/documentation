# High Entropy Blobs

## Description

In the context of open source software, high entropy blobs refer to segments of data within code that exhibit high randomness, often indicative of encoded or encrypted content. These blobs are characterized by their dense and complex structure, which sets them apart from ordinary, predictable code or data. High entropy is typically a sign of obfuscation techniques used to hide sensitive information, such as encryption keys, credentials, or even embedded malicious payloads. Such encoding is designed to evade detection by concealing the true nature of the data.

## Importance

The presence of high entropy blobs in software can be a significant security concern. They are commonly employed by threat actors to obscure malicious code within seemingly benign software packages, making it difficult for traditional security tools to detect and analyze the embedded threats.
