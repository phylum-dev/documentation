## Artifact Repositories

### Azure Artifacts

Azure Artifacts provides support for storing packages from registries with its
"upstream sources" feature. You can provide a custom registry URL, but there is
no support for credentials, which is required for Phylum Package Firewalls.

They also only support custom registries for NPM, which limits its potential
usefulness.
